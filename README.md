I started programming after high school, and I have pursued my studies in computer science. I completed my undergraduate degree at Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman, and currently, I am studying soft computing and artificial intelligence at Islamic Azad University, specifically the Science and Research branch.

During my time as a university student, I developed a keen interest in UI/UX Design and began exploring this field. I realized the potential of combining design and coding, and it became a passion of mine. Organizations like @shecodes have played a significant role in supporting individuals from developing countries, and their offerings have been valuable to me in this journey.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have also taken up teaching as a side job. I started teaching mathematics and Python programming to teenagers after completing high school, which has allowed me to enhance my teaching skills and become a mid-level teacher. I also had the opportunity to work as an intern Python instructor at Yasan Academy for a period of four months, further strengthening my abilities in teaching.

Over time, I have acquired knowledge in various areas such as UI/UX Designing, front-end development, and application programming. I find great joy in engaging in self-study, utilizing tools like Photoshop, and exploring diverse technology-related topics while browsing the internet.

In my free time, I like to engage in activities such as reading books, going for walks, and expressing my creativity through painting. These hobbies provide a well-rounded balance to my life.
